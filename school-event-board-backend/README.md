# School Event Board Backend

The **School Event Board Backend** is a microservices-based system designed to efficiently manage and coordinate school events. It consists of three primary services:

- **Event Service**: Manages event creation, updates, deletions, and retrievals.
- **User Service**: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users about event updates and announcements.

## Architecture

This project follows a microservices architecture, allowing each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Services communicate via RESTful APIs and share common utilities and schemas located in the \shared\ directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.
- **Python 3.8** or higher.

### Running the Services
