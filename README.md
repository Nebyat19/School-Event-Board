# 📅 School Event Board Backend

The **School Event Board** is a platform designed to streamline the management and coordination of school events. It serves as a centralized hub for organizing events, managing users, and sending timely notifications to keep everyone informed. Built with a scalable microservices architecture, the backend is optimized for performance, maintainability, and collaboration.

## 🚀 Features

1. **Event Management**:
   - Create, update, and delete events.
   - Retrieve a list of upcoming or past events.
   - Filter events by date, category, or organizer.

2. **User Management**:
   - User authentication and registration.
   - Assign roles (e.g., student, teacher, admin) for controlled access.
   - Manage user profiles and preferences.

3. **Notification System**:
   - Send notifications for new events or updates to existing ones.
   - Deliver alerts via email or other channels.
   - Track notification history for auditing purposes.

4. **Scalable Architecture**:
   - Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability.
   - Shared utilities and schemas to ensure consistency across services.

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview

The backend is composed of three core microservices:

1. **Event Service**:
   - Handles all event-related operations, including creation, updates, and retrieval.
   - Stores event metadata like title, description, date, time, and location.

2. **User Service**:
   - Manages user authentication, registration, and roles.
   - Ensures secure access control for the platform.

3. **Notification Service**:
   - Sends notifications to users about event updates.
   - Integrates with external services like email or messaging platforms.

## 🌟 How It Works

1. **Admin Role**:
   - Creates events and assigns user roles.
   - Updates event details and schedules notifications.

2. **Teacher Role**:
   - Adds event details for their class or department.
   - Receives notifications about school-wide events.

3. **Student Role**:
   - Views upcoming events.
   - Receives notifications relevant to their enrolled classes or activities.

4. **Real-Time Notifications**:
   - Users are alerted about new events, cancellations, or changes via notifications.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install **Python 3.8+**.
- Install **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-event-board-backend.git
   cd school-event-board-backend
   ```

2. Build and run all services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Access the API:
   - Event Service: [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
   - User Service: [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)
   - Notification Service: [http://localhost:8003](http://localhost:8003)

### Running Locally Without Docker

To run a service locally:
1. Navigate to the service directory:
   ```bash
   cd services/event-service
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the service:
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.app.main:app --reload --port 8001
   ```

## 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines

1. **Branching Workflow**:
   - Do not push directly to the `main` branch.
   - Create a new branch for every feature or bug fix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

2. **Submit Pull Requests (PRs)**:
   - Push your branch and open a PR for code review.
   - Ensure the PR has a clear description of changes.

3. **Code Style**:
   - Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.
   - Include type hints and meaningful docstrings.

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for new features.
   - Run all tests before submitting a PR:
     ```bash
     pytest
     ```

5. **Merge Approvals**:
   - At least one review is required before merging a PR.
